# TRON

## Introduction

This was an university project made with my collage Emiliano Castells in 2007
as a test for Computer Architecture.

Basically it is a two player game, the goal is to avoid walls and yours and
your partner tail, like the Tron Movie.

The game starts the VGA Mode 13h for graphics and connect thought the RS232
port in order to play with a second computer. It is also possible to play both
users in the same computer.
